# MCQ Exam Platform

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a simple, web-based MCQ exam platform designed specifically for private tutors in Bangladesh who need an efficient way to conduct tests for their students. The platform will eliminate the hassle of manually administering the same exam multiple times by providing:

1. Easy test creation & sharing
2. Automated grading & instant results
   The system will be user-friendly, lightweight, and cost-effective, ensuring that even tutors with minimal technical knowledge can use it without hassle.

## Objective (Main Goal)

The main goal is to automate the examination process for private tutors, saving them time and effort while ensuring fair and consistent evaluations for all students. The platform will:

1. Simplify test creation & distribution
2. Automate grading & result generation
3. Save tutors hours of manual work (printing, checking papers).
4. Make exams fair (no cheating via randomized questions).
5. Help students learn better (instant feedback on mistakes).

## Related Work (Existing System)

Existing platforms like Google Forms, Kahoot!, and Moodle offer quiz features but have limitations:

1. Too complex for small-scale private tutors.
2. Lack customization for local education systems (e.g., Bengali language support).
3. Expensive for individual tutors (many LMS platforms charge per student).

This project will bridge these gaps by offering:

1. Simple, intuitive interface (no technical expertise needed).
2. Affordable pricing (free or low-cost for tutors).
3. Localized features (Bengali language).
